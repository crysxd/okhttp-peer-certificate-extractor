# Peer certificate extractor

This tool extracts peer certificates from given certificates.

In order to implement certificate pinning during an SSL connection, a peer certificate needs to be declared first. This peer certificate is a certificateÂ´s public key after being transformed using SHA256 algorithm and base64 encryption. This tool eases the peer certificate extraction task and supports files such as .crt, .der or .pem.

In order to extract a peer certificate:

~~~java
    File certificate = new File(certificateUri);
    String peerCertificate = PeerCertificateExtractor.extract(certificate);
~~~
  
Retrieved peer certificates format:

~~~
    sha256/u4QJrwx7aSejc080BBQKGyTaoJovFBg4SbQ9nhoohb8=

## Okhttp

Enabling okhttp certificate pinning is now made the following way: 

~~~java
    client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
                .certificatePinner(new CertificatePinner.Builder()
                    .add("publicobject.com", peerCertificate)
                    .build())
                .build();
~~~

## Get it

_Step 1:_ Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

~~~
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
~~~

_Step 2:_ Add the dependency

~~~
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.crysxd:okhttp-peer-certificate-extractor:1.0.0'
